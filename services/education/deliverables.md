# Deliverables

Regular technology consulting and training includes next activities & deliverables, applicable
both for individual peer-to-peer consulting sessions and for every participant in class:

- [x] Classroom activities, including, but not limited to, topic introduction, theory background explain,
including expertise sharing, potential pitfalls outline with avoiding examples and workarounds;
- [x] Live-coding led by Consultant, with detailed step explanation and debugging, following audience
involvement and understanding, extending with additional alternative development sampling;
- [x] While walking through real-world tasks and issues, the audience faced on a regular day basis,
generalized sampling way of implementation, skipping parts which participants able to solve
themselves
- [x] Providing materials (e.g., documentation, specifications, best practices posts, public repositories
or recommended libraries) as topic knowledge extension
- [x] Performing and delivering personalized homework for everyone, taking into account their
knowledge and skills level; adapting to real-world tasks, optionally even taken from current
backlog or on-going participants’ activities
- [x] Home work execution support, Q&A sessions, additional on-demand offline peer-to-peer
consulting sessions included with each participant, up to 2 hour
- [x] Personalized home work code review with comments and improvement recommendation notes;
- [x] Shared group retrospective with progress recap and future steps planning and sharing resources
for further reading and research
- [x] Any class work, demos, samples, bookmarks, etc. will be available as compiled document in the
next business week after training performed

## Homework

Most classes include homework, which is shaped to fit each participant’s skill set and proficiency
level, taking into account initial education request and on-going project activities. Home tasks are
delivered as a pull request in the class repository, assigning Consultant as an approver. There are a
couple of automated checks, that should pass before pull request created. Strict recommendation to
use IntelliJ for homework development, as acceptance criteria and steps definition, designed with
JetBrains educational tooling.
On the screenshot below attached one of home task examples (Kubernetes workloads lesson),
with Gherkin DSL and task description and supporting references in markdown on the right.
Completion execution and assertions are regular tests (unit, functional or integration, depending on
the case), hidden from a student, and only pass / fail status available.
